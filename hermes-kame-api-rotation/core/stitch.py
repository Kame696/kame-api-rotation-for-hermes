"""Joining a cut answer to its continuation without printing anything twice.

When a provider closes the stream in the middle of a sentence, the user has
already seen text. Every version of this plugin before 1.1.1 stopped there and
handed the failure back to the host, which appends a synthetic
``[System: The previous response was cut off…]`` row and asks the model to
carry on — visible, ugly, and (because that row moves the server's message
ordinal without moving the client's) the cause of rewind and edit refusing
later in the same session.

The alternative is to continue the answer here, on another key, and show the
user one unbroken response. The only hard part is the seam:

* a model asked to continue from a prefill usually **repeats a few words** of
  it before adding anything new — that overlap must not reach the screen;
* a model may instead **start the whole answer again** from the first word,
  which is the same problem an order of magnitude bigger;
* and it may do neither, picking up mid-word, in which case nothing at all
  should be trimmed.

This module decides which of the three happened and how much of the incoming
text to drop. It is pure: no Hermes, no threads, no clock. That is what lets
the seam be tested with a synthetic stream rather than with a flaky provider.

**What it compares.** Whitespace and case are ignored, because a model that
resumes rarely reproduces the exact spacing of the text it is continuing —
``"the cat"`` and ``"The  cat"`` are the same words and a comparison that says
otherwise leaves the repetition on screen. Positions are mapped back to the
original string so the text that is forwarded keeps its own spacing intact.

**What it refuses to do.** It never invents text, never reorders it, and never
drops anything it has not matched character for character against what the
user already saw. When the continuation stops matching, forwarding resumes
immediately at that point: a seam that reads slightly oddly is a bad sentence,
while a dropped paragraph is a lost answer.
